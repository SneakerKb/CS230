The Gaming Room is the client who wants to develop a game application, Draw It or Lose it, to multiple platforms
aside from the original Android system. The client wants to develop a similar game with the 1980 television game Win, Lose or Draw
where teams are playing to guess what was drawn.

Organizing the system and the proper software development cycle in applying the most suitable software, hardware and tools compatiblity.

The process of understanding the client needs and software requirement help me design and develop a working code suitable for the application.

I would revise the work in connection with the error handling and resolution. Having to have a concrete work around plan in place for any errors.

It is important to always understand the user's requirement in order to have client satisfaction and to build client trust. 

The approach in designing software would be applying different approach in terms of applying customer requirement and needs. Using different methods that would 
fit any enchancement or added functions that would be integrated in the future.
